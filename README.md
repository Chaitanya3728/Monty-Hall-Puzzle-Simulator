# Monty-Hall-Puzzle-Simulator
A Python script simulating the classic Monty Hall problem. Participants choose one of three doors to reveal either a car or a goat. The code explores the strategies of sticking with the original choice or switching doors after a goat is revealed, demonstrating the counterintuitive probability result of the game.
